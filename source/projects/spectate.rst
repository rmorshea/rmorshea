Spectate

Create classes whose instances have tracked methods

Instalation
-----------
``spectate`` can be installed from GitHub using ``pip``:

.. code:: text
    
    $ pip install git+https://github.com/rmorshea/spectate.git#egg=spectate

Basic Usage
-----------
``spectate`` is useful for remotely tracking how an instance is modified. This means that protocols
for managing updates, don't need to be the outward responsibility of a user, and can instead be
done automagically in the background.

For instance, if it were desirable to keep track of element changes in a list, ``spectate`` could be
used to observe ``list.__setitiem__`` in order to be notified when a user sets the value of an element
in the list. To do this, we would first create a ``ListSpectator`` that inherits from ``Spectator``:

.. code-block:: python

    from spectate import Spectator

    class ListSpectator(Spectator):
        
        def __init__(self, inst):
            super(ListSpectator, self).__init__(inst)
            self._change = {'old': None, 'new': None}
        
        def instance_will_call(self, name, args, kwargs):
            # we know the name will be __setitem__
            # since that's all we're spectating
            index, new = args
            try:
                old = self.inst[index]
            except:
                pass
            else:
                if old != new:
                    self._change['old'] = {index: old}
                    self._change['new'] = {index: new}
        
        def instance_post_call(self, name, returned):
            o, n = self._change['old'], self._change['new']
            if o and n:
                print("%s : %r -> %r" % (name, o, n))
                self._change['old'] = None
                self._change['new'] = None

``instance_will_call`` considers the argments being passed to ``__setitem__`` and determines whether
the value of the element being set will be different. If it's different, the new and old values
are cached. Then, ``instance_post_call`` checks for a change, and prints it if there was.

To implement ``ListSpectator``, all we need to do is create a ``WatchedList`` class using ``WatchedType``:

.. code-block:: python

    WatchedList = WatchedType('WatchedList', list, ListSpectator, '__setitem__')


The instances of ``WatchedList`` will behave exactly like a ``list`` in every way. The only difference being
that when a user decides to change the value of a preexisting element, the spectator is notified, and
will print once the action is complete:

.. code-block:: python

    l = WatchedList([1, 2, 3])
    l[0] = 0

Prints ``__setitem__ : {0: 1} -> {0: 0}``

Under The Hood
--------------
Methods are tracked by using ``WatchedType`` to create a new class with ``method_spectator`` descriptors in
the place of specified methods. At the time an instance of this class is created, a spectator that weakly
references it is assigned under the attribute name ``instance_spectator``. When a ``method_spectator``
is accessed through an instance, the descriptor will return a new wrapper function that notifies the
``instance_spectator`` of the fact that the wrapper is being called. 

The instance's spectator is pinged before and after the wrapper function returned by a ``method_spectator``
calls its base method. This fully communicates what will happen, and what has happened to the instance
when the base method is called - the preemptive notification is sent with the arguments of the call and the
name of the base method, while afterwards, the base method's name and the call's result are sent to the
spectator.
