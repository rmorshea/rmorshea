Ising
=====

A quick implementation of a classic, and simple, representation
of ferromagnetism from thermodynamics in both Python and Mathematica.
All documentation for Mathematica version of the model is given in the notebook
itself. What's below pertains only to the Python version.

Installation
------------

This module can be installed with
`antipackage <https://github.com/rmorshea/antipackage>`_
using the following commands:

.. code-block:: python

	import antipackage
	from github.rmorshea.ising import ising

Dependancies: `IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_,
`PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_,
`images2gif <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/images2gif>`_

Usage
-----

**Animated GIFs:**

Begin by making a lattice populated with upward or downward polarized ferromagnets:

.. code-block:: python

	lat = ising.Lattice(x, y, dist, T, nghbrs, size)
	lat

:y: int
    length of the lattice's y dimension
:x: int
    length of the lattice's x dimension
:dist: float
    the distribution of spin up to spin down (between 0 and 1)
:T: float or list
    Given a number, the lattice will remain at a constant temp
    throughout anamations and analysis. However given a list of
    temperatures the lattice will progress through them during
    animation.
:nghbrs: int
    the number of neighbors influencing a particular unit (4 or 8)
:size: int
    size of the rendered units

Animate ``lat`` by specifying how many saved frames should be used,
and how many time steps each one will represent (this step may take some time).
Then to prepare the frames for ``images2gif``, save each one in a directory as
numbered png files with:

.. code-block:: python

	lat.animate(time_steps, frames)
	lat.make_pngs()
	
Finally the last step is to create your GIF with `lat.make_gif()`:
	
.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmorshea/ising/master/docs/Teq1.5.GIF
	:width: 200
	:height: 200
	
**Model Analysis:**

Standard information about the model is given by the output of ``lat.analyze()``. This returns the average magnitization, avg energy, and heat capacity at each frame of animation. Alternatively, ``lat.get_potentials`` returns the average energy and squared average anergy at each frame.

For more detailed information see ``lat.U``, ``lat.S``, and ``lat.rgbs`` for raw data potential, spin, and rgb arrays from each frame of the model's animation.
